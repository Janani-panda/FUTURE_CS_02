# Security Alert Monitoring &amp; Incident Response using Splunk (DNS Analysis)
As part of my cybersecurity internship with Future Interns, this task focused on monitoring and analyzing DNS logs using Splunk, a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool. The objective was to identify suspicious DNS activities, such as unusual query patterns, spikes in requests, and potential command-and-control (C2) communications.
# Objective
The primary objectives of this task were to:
- Set up and explore Splunk Cloud for DNS log analysis.
- Ingest and analyze simulated DNS logs.
- Identify anomalies (e.g., unusual domains, spikes in queries, suspicious source IPs).
- Classify incidents based on severity (High, Medium, Low).
- Document findings in a structured Incident Response Report.
# Tools & Environment
- 🌐 Splunk Cloud (Free Trial) – SIEM tool for log analysis.
- 📄 Sample DNS Logs – Simulated DNS query data.
- 🖥 Edge Browser – For accessing Splunk dashboards.
- 📸 Snipping Tool – To capture screenshots.
# Deliverables
- ✅ Incident Response Report
- 📸 Screenshots of log investigation in Splunk
- 📊 Alert Severity Classification Table based on event type
- 🧠 Summary of learnings from real-world SOC simulation
# Learnings
- Hands-on experience with SIEM tools
- Performed real-time log analysis & event correlation
- Understood incident lifecycle: detection → classification → response
- Practiced writing professional incident reports for security teams
